### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (AJAX primarily relies on JavaScript and HTTP requests to exchange data between a client computer and a Web server.)
2. (With AJAX, the JavaScript does not have to wait for the server response, but can instead execute other scripts while waiting for the server response.)
3. (An HTTP response message returns to the client the message and the status code. If the status code is 200, then the request was successful.)
